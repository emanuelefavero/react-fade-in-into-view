#### GIF Example

> Note: The gif is not a real-time representation of the animation

## Usage

- clone this repo, then:

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

## TIPS

- **The only important part is the `FadeIntoView` component** and its css. The rest is just for demo purposes (`index.css` is just for styling, not essential).

- _NOTE: Please remember that **any element inside `<FadeInSection />` will have a `.fade-into-view` div as the parent**_
